# Palindrome_Challenge

## Description

https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-python/
This LinkedIn Learning course had a coding challenge with Python.

The challenge is to take a list of words and sentences, and then create a program that sorts through them and finds all of the pallindromes in the list. I took it a step further than the challenge, by adding text that breaks down the list, telling you in detail how many pallindromes there are, as well as what words happen to be palindromes.
